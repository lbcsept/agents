### **Comprehensive Summary of Git Merge and Conflict Resolution Discussion**

#### **1. Conversation Overview**

The discussion focused on resolving Git merge conflicts between two branches (`backup-from-home` and `from_terra`), with the goal of preserving both versions of conflicting files. The conversation progressed from initial merge attempts to exploring automated conflict resolution strategies, culminating in a manual approach to retain both versions of conflicting files.

#### **2. Active Development**

- **Merge Operation**:
    
    - The primary action was merging `backup-from-home` into `from_terra` using:
        
        Bash
        
        Run
        
        ```bash
        git checkout from_terra
        git merge backup-from-home
        ```
        
    - Git identified conflicts in files, prompting manual resolution.
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
    
    - **Manual Resolution**: Conflicting files were edited to include both versions, with conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) removed.
    - **Automated Separation**:
        - Used `git checkout --ours` and `git checkout --theirs` to extract versions from each branch.
        - Renamed files to distinguish between versions (e.g., `<file>.from_terra` and `<file>.backup-from-home`).

#### **3. Technical Stack**

- **Version Control**: Git (CLI commands)
- **Conflict Resolution Tools**:
    - Git’s built-in merge conflict markers.
    - `git checkout --ours` and `--theirs` for version extraction.
- **File Operations**: Standard file renaming and editing (e.g., `mv`, text editor).

#### **4. File Operations**

- **Conflicting Files**:
    - Modified during merge to include both versions.
    - Renamed to preserve versions (e.g., `<file>.from_terra`, `<file>.backup-from-home`).
- **Key Commands**:
    
    Bash
    
    Run
    
    ```bash
    git status          # Identify conflicting files.
    git checkout --ours <file>  # Extract current branch's version.
    git checkout --theirs <file> # Extract merged branch's version.
    git add <file>     # Stage resolved files.
    git commit         # Finalize merge.
    git push origin from_terra  # Push changes.
    ```
    

#### **5. Solutions & Troubleshooting**

- **Problem**: Git did not automatically preserve both versions of conflicting files.
- **Solution**:
    - Manually edited files to include both versions.
    - Used `git checkout --ours` and `--theirs` to extract and rename versions.
- **Workaround**: No direct Git command exists to automate this; manual intervention was required.

#### **6. Outstanding Work**

- **Next Steps**:
    - Verify that all conflicts are resolved and both versions are preserved.
    - Push the final merged branch (`from_terra`) to the remote repository.
    - Document the conflict resolution process for future reference.

### **Conclusion**

The discussion successfully addressed the challenge of preserving both versions of conflicting files during a Git merge. The solution involved a combination of manual editing and Git’s built-in conflict resolution tools. Future work should focus on verifying the merge and pushing the changes to the remote repository.
