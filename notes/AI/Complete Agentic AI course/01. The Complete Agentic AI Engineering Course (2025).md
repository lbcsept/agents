### Description

2025 is the year that Agents enter the workforce. This is nothing short of a watershed moment for Artificial Intelligence. It has never been more important to be an expert with Agentic AI. And that is precisely the goal of this course: to equip you with the skills and expertise to design, build and deploy Autonomous AI Agents, opening up new career and commercial opportunities.

This is an intensive 6-week program to master Agentic AI. We start by building foundational expertise, connecting LLMs using proven design patterns. Then, each week, we upskill with new frameworks: OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph and Autogen. The course culminates with a full week on the remarkable opportunities opened up by MCP.

Above all, this is a hands-on course. I’m a big believer that the best way to learn is by DOING. So please prepare to roll up your sleeves! We’ll build 8 real-world projects; some are astonishing, some are intriguing, and some are quite surreal. But one thing’s for sure: all are powerful demonstrations of Agentic AI’s potential to utterly transform the business landscape.

So come join me on this comprehensive 6-week journey. By the end, you will have mastered Agentic AI. You will have expertise in all the major frameworks. You’ll be well-versed in the strengths and traps of Agentic AI. You’ll confidently unleash Autonomous Agents to solve real-world commercial problems. And along the way, you’ll have had a whole lot of fun with the astounding, groundbreaking technology that is Agentic AI.
